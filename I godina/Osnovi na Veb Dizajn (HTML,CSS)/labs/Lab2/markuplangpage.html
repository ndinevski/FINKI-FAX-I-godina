    <h1>Markup language</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <strong>Markup language</strong> performed combining of the text with some additional information related to the text. <br> <span style="color:red">Additional information</span>, such as the structure of the text and the way of its presentation,
        is expressed using markers that are inserted in the <br> <u>primary text.</u> The best known language for marking into a modem use is <strong><u>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</u></strong>. Historically marking has <br> been used (and is still
        used) in publishing in the process of communication between authors, publishers and printers. Languages for marking <br> are often divided into three classes: <span style="background-color:yellow">presentational, procedural and descriptive.</span>
